This is the README.md for Homework5. For this assignment we had to create a functioning workday scheduler. The bullet points below are the highlights on the assignment.
* Functioning date tracker
* Functioning time tracker
* A clear schedule button that will automatically erase what has been logged and saved
* Functioning localStorage that keeps scheuled items saved even if the page is refreshed
* HTML used through bootstrap and tied to javascript to simplify some of the code
